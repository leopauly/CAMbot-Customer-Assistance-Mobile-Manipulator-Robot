This was the first application developed for CAMbot.It is a recommendation system based on face recognition.
This robotic vision application introduces a novel method for product recommendation for customers based on their previous shopping history. The 
system recognizes the customerâ€™s identity using the facial image of the customer and pulls out his previous buying history. Then the recommendation algorithms are applied on this data and are used to 
find the items that the customer is most likely to buy and recommend them. The system includes the use  of face detection using haar based cascade classifier, face recognition using Eigen faces, gender and 
emotion detection using fisher faces and recommendation algorithms.

PS: The codes used for eigen faces and fisher faces has been downloded from the internet and has been modified to suit the application.
